5. Make it run on boot

This is the hardest part if you don't really know what you're doing.

You can define things to run on boot in /etc/rc.local. In that shell script, you don't have the same path as when you log in, so just running node app.js won't do the trick.

I tried a lot of different things that all gave errors like Illegal instruction or Permission denied or File not found.

What does work, is running one command as the default pi user. Because that user does have node in his path, the command is known.

su pi -c 'node /home/pi/server.js < /dev/null &'
